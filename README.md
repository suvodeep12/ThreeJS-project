- Smooth animation loop

## Libraries Used

- [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) - A JavaScript 3D library that makes creating WebGL applications easy.
- [OrbitControls](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html?q=orbit#examples/en/controls/OrbitControls) - A controller that allows the user to manipulate the camera using mouse and touch controls.

## Acknowledgments

This project was inspired by [Fireship's](https://www.youtube.com/@Fireship) [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7AOvWpIVHU), which demonstrated how to create a similar webpage using ThreeJS.

The textures used in this project were downloaded from [solarsystemscope.com](https://www.solarsystemscope.com/textures/) and [textures.com](https://www.textures.com/).
